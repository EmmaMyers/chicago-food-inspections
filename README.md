Analyzing chicago food inspections

Recent watchdog report published by Chicago Tribune indcated that food safety inspectors overlook hundreds of day cares in the city of Chicago.

The key take away from the Chicago Tribune watchdog report is that the city had only 33 working field inspectors to cover the entire city of Chicago. Many of the facilties serve food for Children, and while few fail inspectionns, many escape routine inspections.

This is a classic resource allocation problem. In this assignment, our goal is to identify the hot-spots (areas that have facilities serving food to children and have failed inspections in the past) on the Chicago map to dispatch inspectors to.

To achive our goal, we need the following:
Dataset for Chicago Food Inspections

NoSQL database Egnine (ElasticSearch) for indexing and data retrieval
HeatMap to plot the children facilties that failed Chicago Food Inspections

The CSV file for dataset of the city of chicago is obtained from the data portal for the city of Chicago. Here th elink for the city of Chicago data portal City of Chicago Data Portal
